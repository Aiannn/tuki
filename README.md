# Tuki the Game

## 1. Overview

Tuki the Game is a 2D endless runner built with Flutter for mobile devices (iOS/Android). The game mechanics combine elements of Flappy Bird and Hill Climb Racing. The main character, **Tuki**, automatically moves forward while carrying a **stack of boxes** on his shoulders. The player must balance the stack by tapping the screen to prevent it from tipping over.

## 2. Core Mechanics

- **Character Movement:**

  - Tuki moves automatically from **left to right**.
  - The **stack of boxes** tilts automatically **counterclockwise**.
  - The player must **tap the screen** to tilt the stack **clockwise** and maintain balance.

- **Terrain Influence:**

  - **Uphill:** The stack tilts more **counterclockwise**.
  - **Downhill:** The stack tilts **clockwise** at a slower rate.
  - Terrain is randomly generated within predefined limits.

- **Game Over Condition:**
  - If the stack tilts beyond a certain **critical angle**, the game ends.

## 3. Score System

- Score is based on:
  - **Time survived**.
  - **How long the player keeps the stack near the critical angle**.
  - These parameters should be adjustable for fine-tuning.

## 4. Technologies & Tools

- **Flutter** (for cross-platform mobile development)
- **Flame Engine** (game engine for Flutter)
- **Forge2D** (for physics, terrain generation)

## 5. Game Architecture

The game will be structured into the following core components:

1. **Tuki (Character Class):** Handles movement.
2. **Stack (Box Stack Class):** Controls box balancing physics.
3. **Terrain (Landscape Class):** Manages terrain generation and physics.
4. **ScoreCounter:** Manages the scoring system.

## 6. Development Approach (Scrum)

To structure development and avoid stress, we will follow an **Agile/Scrum** approach with user stories and spikes.

### **User Stories**

#### **Sprint 1: Core Mechanics & Physics**

1. _As a player, I want Tuki to move automatically from left to right so that I donâ€™t have to control movement._
2. _As a player, I want the stack of boxes to tilt automatically so that I must focus on balancing them._
3. _As a player, I want to tap the screen to adjust the tilt of the stack so that I can maintain balance._
4. _As a developer, I want to create a test level with static terrain to verify movement and balance mechanics._
   4.1 _As s a player, I want to have critical value of boxes stack tilting angle, so if tilting exceeds critical angle game over. And user have to click to start game again._

#### **Sprint 2: Terrain & Randomization**

5. _As a player, I want the terrain to be dynamically generated so that each game session is unique._
6. _As a player, I want different slopes (uphill, downhill) to affect balance difficulty so that the game is more challenging._
7. _As a developer, I want to fine-tune the terrain generation parameters to keep gameplay balanced._

#### **Sprint 3: Score System & UI**

8. _As a player, I want to earn points based on survival time so that I am rewarded for lasting longer._
9. _As a player, I want additional points for keeping the stack close to the critical angle so that balance matters._
10. _As a player, I want to see my score on the screen during gameplay._
11. _As a developer, I want to allow score-related parameters to be adjustable for future tuning._

#### **Sprint 4: Game Over & Polish**

12. _As a player, I want the game to end when the stack tilts too much so that I have a clear failure condition._
13. _As a player, I want a Game Over screen that shows my final score._
14. _As a developer, I want to add animations and visual effects for feedback._

### **Spikes (Research Tasks)**

- Research best physics implementation for balancing mechanics.
- Experiment with different terrain generation algorithms in Forge2D.
- Optimize tap responsiveness for mobile controls.

## 7. Goals & Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Implement movement and basic physics.
- **Week 3-4:** Add terrain generation and difficulty scaling.
- **Week 5-6:** Implement scoring and UI elements.
- **Week 7-8:** Polish animations, optimize performance, and refine gameplay balance.

By following this structured plan, we aim to complete development in **1-2 months** with an iterative, stress-free approach.
